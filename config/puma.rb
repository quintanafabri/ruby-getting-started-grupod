# please see the Puma 6 and prior configuration section below.

# Puma 7+ already supports PUMA_PERSISTENT_TIMEOUT natively. Older Puma versions set:
#
# ```
# persistent_timeout(ENV.fetch("PUMA_PERSISTENT_TIMEOUT") { 95 }))

# Puma 7+ fixes a keepalive issue that affects long tails response time with Router 2.0.
# Older Puma versions set:
#
# ```
# enable_keep_alives(false) if respond_to?(:enable_keep_alives)
